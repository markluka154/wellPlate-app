## Known Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Calendar Integration Complexity
**Problem:** Google Calendar and Apple Calendar have different APIs, permissions, and sync methods.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Abstract calendar service layer
interface CalendarService {
  connect(provider: 'google' | 'apple'): Promise<void>
  syncEvents(startDate: Date, endDate: Date): Promise<CalendarEvent[]>
  detectConflicts(mealTimes: MealTime[]): Promise<Conflict[]>
}

// Implement for each provider
class GoogleCalendarService implements CalendarService {
  // Use Google Calendar API v3
}

class AppleCalendarService implements CalendarService {
  // Use iCloud Calendar API
}

// Use strategy pattern
const calendarService = provider === 'google' 
  ? new GoogleCalendarService() 
  : new AppleCalendarService()
```

### Challenge 2: ML Model Training Data
**Problem:** Need sufficient meal reaction data to train preference learning model.

**Solution:**
1. Start with rule-based system (if-then logic)
2. Collect data passively (which meals are served, which are skipped)
3. Active prompts: "How did Emma like the broccoli?" (emoji reactions)
4. Train model incrementally as data accumulates
5. Use transfer learning from similar food preference datasets

### Challenge 3: Real-Time Performance
**Problem:** Dashboard needs to load fast even with complex calculations.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Implement aggressive caching
const cacheStrategy = {
  // Cache meal plans in Redis (1 hour TTL)
  mealPlans: 'redis',
  
  // Cache calendar events in memory (15 min TTL)
  calendarEvents: 'memory',
  
  // Pre-calculate insights nightly
  insights: 'background-job',
  
  // Use optimistic UI updates
  optimisticUpdates: true,
  
  // Implement pagination for long lists
  pagination: { pageSize: 20 }
}
```

### Challenge 4: Family Data Privacy
**Problem:** Family data is sensitive, especially children's information.

**Solution:**
1. Encrypt all PII at rest (AES-256)
2. Separate authentication for adults vs children
3. Parental controls for what children can access
4. COPPA compliance for children under 13
5. Clear data retention and deletion policies
6. Easy data export (GDPR compliance)
